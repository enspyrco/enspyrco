## This document is very much a WIP 

### PRs 

#### Reviews and Merging 

- Generally only 1 approval is required before merging, if the PR has been up for more than 24 hours.  The exceptions are: 
  - Files in the `.contributing/` folder, where approvals are needed from the whole team before merging
- If there are approvals from everyone, merge at will.
- When a PR has approval(s), if someone else wants changes we don't merge until the request is resolved.
- The reviewer merges when they are happy that everything has been addressed 
- Please use "Changes requested" to hand back control until all questions have been resolved (in order to avoid the ambiguous state of unanswered questions in an approved PR) 
- All merges onto `dev` should be squashed (with the squash & merge option at merge time) 

#### Treat PRs as the start of a process, not the end 

- When you finish a PR you have setup the next stage, which is a collaborative process. 
- Questions and discussion should be welcomed as an attempt to improve our project. If you feel frustrated, try to get to the bottom of it and consider having a conversation with the person involved.

#### Reviewing a PR is a collaboration, not gatekeeping 

- When reviewing a PR, if you have a suggestion, try creating a new branch off the PR branch and putting up a PR with your changes. 
- Try to create a collaborative spirit. 

## Aspire to be in flow 

### Mind like water 

#### Clean up clutter 

ALWAYS close loops 

- when something lands in your space (eg. someone asks a question or suggests an action) try to identify any open loops and close them: 
  - acknowledge receipt ASAP 
  - create a task/issue to track (and link back to the original interaction if possible) 

TRY to remove all mental references for GC 
- same idea as "ALWAYS close loops" but different analogy 
- acknowledge receipt so the person can release the reference they are holding about the communication 
- create issues/tasks so there is a single external reference rather than several mental references 

ALWAYS reply straight away 
- the loss of focus is probably worth it 
- if you don't want to lose focus, turn off notifications 

TRY to be a Clean Team Member 
- clean as in clean code but relating to working in a team 
- things that land in your space get taken care of so others can avoid needing to keep track 
- communicate clearly and constructively any mental 'stuff' that is taking up head space 
- help other team members by quickly and effectively responding to their mental stuff so we clean it up together 

PREFER using Asana over email 

DO keep workspaces highly organised 
- Asana workspaces are public spaces, meaning the state we leave the space in has an effect on the rest of the team 
- if a workspace/section/column has a purpose, remove anything that doesn't serve that purpose 
- we each have a column on the Team Board project of the CrowdLeague workspace, with the purpose of describing our day - what we're currently working on and what we plan to complete in the session.

DO attempt to communicate effectively when creating tasks/issues/etc. 
- so that other team members (and you) can read the tasks/issues/etc. quickly and have a good idea of what it is about  
- it can be helpful to: 
  - break down large tasks/issues into smaller pieces 
  - try and read what you've written with the mindset of someone who doesn't have all the context that you currently do 

#### Standups

DO share your progress with the team
- Get the team up to speed on where you are in your workflow.
- Identify anything blocking you.
- Finish with a "maptivation" statement: 
  - draw us a map of where we're going today
  - get us excited about getting there 

AVOID blocking the flow 
- Try to prevent discussions that are not relevant to standup 
- Push any such discussions to post-standup 
  
DO take action to avoid wasted time 
- Feel free to speak up should a discussion that is wasting your time erupt
  
DO respond positively to requests to move conversations to post-standup  
- If anyone requests that a conversation is moved to post-standup, the response should be freindly and respectful.
